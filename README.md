PREDICT CLOSED QUESTIONS ON STACK OVERFLOW
============

## Project dependencies


This project aims to develop a machine learning model using Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) to predict whether a question posted on Stack Overflow will be closed. This can assist moderators in identifying potentially low-quality questions and improve the overall platform's efficiency.

Requirements
--------

* Python 3.6+
* Necessary libraries (install using `pip install <library_name>`)
  *   `transformer`
  *   `torch` (GPU-accelerated training highly recommended)
  *   `pandas`
  *   `numpy`
  *   `sklearn` (for preprocessing)

DATA
---------------

* The code assumes you have access to a Stack Overflow dataset containing questions (textual content), labels indicating whether they were *open*, *not a real question*, *not constructive*, *too localized* or *off topic*, and potentially additional features like tags, timestamps, or user information.
* Download or prepare your dataset accordingly.
